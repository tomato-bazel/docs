Real usage, taken from the module's `examples/`.

### examples/diff_gate/BUILD.bazel

```starlark
load("@spec//tools:diff.bzl", "emit_diff_test")

package(default_visibility = ["//visibility:public"])

# Stand-in for a real emitter (lean_emit / genrule): produces a file
# byte-identical to the committed copy, so the gate passes.
genrule(
    name = "generated",
    srcs = ["committed.txt"],
    outs = ["generated.txt"],
    cmd = "cp $< $@",
)

# Smoke: the gate is green when the generated artifact matches the committed
# copy. (The failure path — drift → exit 1 — is exercised by real consumers.)
emit_diff_test(
    name = "generated_diff_test",
    generated = ":generated",
    committed = "committed.txt",
    update_target = "//examples/diff_gate:update_generated",
)
```
